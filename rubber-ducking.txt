I am sure I am going to regret some of this file structure lol 

ok so I can use some sample images to detect lying and other emotional intelligence questions based on pictures 
	I can probably get them by looking back as the Unanimous Paper on EQ (https://unanimous.ai/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Amplifying-Social-Intelligence-IEEE-ai4i-2018.pdf)

let's try to update the rank of the questions based on their votes 
	this is the way you sort an array of objects by value (https://www.javascripttutorial.net/array/javascript-sort-an-array-of-objects/)
		I also checked that this works in the browser
	now I just have to do it in state 

now that I've hooked up Firebase (get it, "hooked" up ahahha), let's figure out the optimal JSON structure
	uhm, I guess I have not figured out how to update Firebase from the app lol 
	how do I update the rank of the questions
		I should probably just sort them by value
	maybe I should calculate the score by adding the scores from all participants
		Yea, that makes sense  

	firebase {
		combo {
			pictureA: "dogA_id",
			pictureB: "dogB_id",
			features: {
				"preset_feature_A": {
					"score": {
						0: 0
						1: .2
						2: .3
					}
					"weight": 12
				},
				"generated_feature_A": {
					"score": {
						0: 0
						1: .5
						2: .2
					}
					"weight": 11
				},
			}
		}
	}
